* Indent using 2 spaces rather than tabs to conserve space and help prevent line wrapping. Be sure to set this preference in Xcode and in the Project settings as shown below:

![Xcode indent settings](screens/indentation.png)

* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
* Tip: You can re-indent by selecting some code (or **Command-A** to select all) and then **Control-I** (or **Editor ▸ Structure ▸ Re-Indent** in the menu). Some of the Xcode template code will have 4-space tabs hard coded, so this is a good way to fix that.

**Preferred**:
```swift
if user.isHappy {
  // Do something
} else {
  // Do something else
}
```

**Not Preferred**:
```swift
if user.isHappy
{
  // Do something
}
else {
  // Do something else
}
```
