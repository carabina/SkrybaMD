The architecture is the structure and description of a system/enterprise.
It enables the implementation, understanding, maintenance, repair and further development of a system/enterprise. 
The architect describes a system (enterprise) in an architecture in order to enable its usage, fixing, building and further development.
The architect specifies the architecture,  which essentially consists of a set of integrated blueprints,  starting from requirements and past cases.
The designers/engineers though, take over the blueprint from the architect to further design (the parts of) the architecture to the detail necessary for implementation, proper usage, maintenance and further development.
The architecture describes primarily the current system/enterprise.
It may also describe the target system/enterprise in order to visualise its end state.
